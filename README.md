#PS2Stats

#About
**PS2Stats** is an AngularJS application for Planetside 2 using SOE's [Census API](http://census.soe.com/).

The purpose of the application is to allow users to navigate the contents of the API in a responsive format using Twitter Bootstrap.

This is primarily an exercise in learning how to structure an Angular application before I move deeper into the MEAN stack.
