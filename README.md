#PS2Stats

#About
**PS2Stats** is an AngularJS application for Planetside 2 using SOE's [Census API](http://census.soe.com/).

The purpose of the application is to allow users to navigate the contents of the API in a responsive format using Twitter Bootstrap.

This is primarily an exercise in learning how to structure an Angulas application before I move deeper into the MEAN stack.

#Example
[Player Data](http://ps2stats.seanspradlin.com/#/player/higby)

#Structure
`BaseSvc` contains utility services to be consumed by child services and controllers.
`player/` contains details about individual players.
